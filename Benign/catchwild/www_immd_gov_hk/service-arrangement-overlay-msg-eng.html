footnote += '<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Persons who are aged below 12 or aged 65 or above, and those with disabilities that render use of the app difficult, will be exempted from the requirement of using the app when they enter government buildings and offices. However, they are required to complete a specified record form to register their names, the first four digits or letters of their identification documents, their contact numbers and the date and time of their visits. They also need to present relevant identification documents for verification at the request of the staff on-site during registration. The staff will verify the contact numbers by making phone calls. We also remind the public that any person who knowingly provides information that is false or misleading in a material particular is liable to prosecution. Furthermore, under the new arrangement, unwillingness to use the app will not be considered as justification for granting exemption.
